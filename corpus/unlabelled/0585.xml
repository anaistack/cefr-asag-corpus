                <p>The beste is to have a funny job well paid. But that exists only in a pink world.</p>
                <p>So, I think it's better to start your job life with a well paied job also this one is boring, stressing, etc. When you are young, you have more energy, you are more incline to accept things that with experience and years, you will not accept anymore.</p>
                <p>And , later on,  in your professional life, if you have the luxuary to give up this king of job, you can chose a job more appropiate to yourself.</p>
                <p>That's my feeling about your question.</p>
                <p>I do not know if I have at least 100 words and to be honnest I do not want to count ....  Ah ok , the red light disappeared.</p>
