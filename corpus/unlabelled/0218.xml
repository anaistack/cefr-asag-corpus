                <p>If I would have one million euros buy a villa in South of France next to the beach with a big swimming pool. Then I would invite  my best  friends there to make a big Party. I would enjoy the sea, the sun, the beach,... I would also buy a yacht to make beautiful trips to places. Of course I would also make al lot of shopping.</p>
                <p>I would also built luxury stables for my horses at the villa in France. I would organise big jumping events.</p>
                <p>I woud also make a trip in the United States for some weeks and maybe also in Asia to discover the world.</p>
