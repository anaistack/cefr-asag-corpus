                <p>If I won 1 million euros,I would take a professional pause to travel around the world with my husband. I would begin in the USA because my husband like USA and dreams to go back there. Then I would ask a part time to have more time for my family and for the others.</p>
                <p>I would also spend time for hippotherapy ( therapy with horses and handicapes persons)</p>
                <p>I would give some money to my parents to help their to have a better life.</p>
                <p>I would help my sister to pay her house and to finish it.</p>
                <p>If I won 1 million euros, perhaps would i do crazy thinks but I can't imagine this situation and I can't see me like a rich woman.</p>
