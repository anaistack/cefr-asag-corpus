                <p>Hi everyone !</p>
                <p>This last summer I went to the Spa Festival so here my review about my experience there.</p>
                <p>I've stay there for the five days. And I sleept in a camping, well it was quite an adventure because there were no shower, we had to wash ourselves in the sink.</p>
                <p>The singers invited were really good, on that topic I have nothing to say, I have enjoy almost every artists.</p>
                <p>The only issue I had is that the drinks are really expensive ! It was 4 euro for a beer ! Can you imagine ? So my friends and I had to by our drinks in a supermarket.</p>
                <p>I will conclude by saying that it was a good experience and I think I'm going back this summer.</p>
                <p>Bye everyone, take care.</p>
