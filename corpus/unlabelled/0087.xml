                <p>Last year, I went with my best friend at Saint-Raphael in France. It probabily was the best holiday of my life. We took the car and we went on the roat during 13 hours. When we arrived, we found an apartement on the beach. Every day, I swam and I did sport. To night, we ate at the restaurant and we went to do party. One day, when I  was sleeping, I saw a pretty dog on the beach. But he had been losting... We searched the proprietor and we found a french girl. So during the rest of the journey, we rest with her and her dog to do a lot of activities with her friends.</p>
