                <p>If I had 1 million euros, I would certainely buy a big field to set up a little autonomous village. I would have my own farm and animals. Of course I would have to learn very much, but I would also look after qualified and interested persons to fulfil this project. We would have to build systems to make our electricity and bring drinkable water.</p>
                <p>With the rest of the money I would fund developement projects or maybe, who knows, builld up my own association. It would be greatful if I really could do something against climate change and environment.</p>
                <p>But if 1 million euros should change my interests, I would prefer not to have it.</p>
