                <p>In 10 years, i will be a mother. i will have 2 children, a girl and a boy. the girl will be 6 years old and the boy 4. I won't live with the father of my children but it's too complicated to love someone. But even if we will be separated, we will keep a good relationship, like brothers and sisters. I will have a lovestory with an another man. But we won't live together because i will want to keep my autonomny. Freedom is my life. My mother will be still alive but my father would have died many years before. I and will have forget him. I will live in a little and charming house in the countryside. My sister will be very closed to me.</p>
