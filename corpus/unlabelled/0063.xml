                <p>Two days ago, I was in Gran Canaria, a little Espan Island in front of Marrakech. I went with my family for a week in a huge hotel nearly the beach. The second day after we've got our room, we decided to go in a trip for visiting the Island. So we hide a car, which was very small for us because of we are five. We had decided to go on the top of the Island for having a view of all. But, after nearly 3hours driven, we arrived in a terrible storm. Because of the travel was so long, we decided to go on the top despite the weather. Arrived at the top, we didn't see anything but a huge cloud in which we was..</p>
