                <p>Next, is the memory of the best holiday I had in the past few years. I went, with my father, my sister and my step-mother, in Egypt; to Sharm-El-Sheik, a beautiful tourist resort, on the coast of the Red Sea. Sharm-El-Sheik is known worldwide for its sea and its magnificent marine fauna and flora. So, we decided to go there to dive. We passed all our days on a big diving boat, went diving and saw extraordinary things such as dolphins, sharks, but also turtles and colorful corals. On the boat, we couls also appreciate the sun and the nice typical Egyptian meals. Indeed, it was one of the bast holiday I ever had.</p>
