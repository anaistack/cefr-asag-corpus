                <p>We all want to go, at least once in your entire life in a music festival. It's something really special and exiting ! I'm sure you already heard about the well known Belgiam festival called &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; but I'm not going to talk about this festival.</p>
                <p>You're probably wandering why ... Because we don't always have a lot of money to attend those expensive festival.</p>
                <p>You're looking for something AMAZING, just like Tomorrowland , with the same worldwide singers : Let me introduce you to Sziget festival.</p>
                <p>It takes place in the heart of the beautiful city of Budapest on a private isle !</p>
                <p>And gess what ? It cost less than 10 000 ft (hungarian money) for the night.</p>
                <p>So for 5 days of festival you'll pay 250 â‚¬ witch is the cost of one day at Tomorrowland festival !</p>
                <p>The only thing you need to do right know is book your flight and your ready for the adventure of you lifetime !</p>
