                <p>If I had 1 million euro, I would first give money to associations against cancer or associations like &quot;les restos du coeur&quot; because I think it's very important to help people in the need.</p>
                <p>Also, I would give a part to my family to help them to achieve their dreams.</p>
                <p>And in my case, I would travel to see the differents wonderful landscapes all around the world and maybe buy a house in south America.</p>
                <p>But in reality, I think money is not the best way to be happy. Money can not buy happiness, so... I don't have other idea of what I would do with it.</p>
