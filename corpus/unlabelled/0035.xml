                <p>I remember last year when I went to Berlin with my friends. Every night in the central square of the city, there were a lot of street artists. They were doing a lot of things such as singing, doing some magic tricks and so one. I think this kind of animations are very graceful. And especially during summer when a lot tourists are visiting the city. The atmosphere is more relaxed and Berlin's life is more attractive the nights.</p>
