                <p>The best book I have ever read is Harry Potter.</p>
                <p>I bought the first when I was 12 years old, so it was my first &quot;real book&quot;, I mean before I'd only read books for children with few text and a lot of pictures. I have read this book thanks to the movie. I saw the first and I wasn't able to wait 1 year to discover the rest of the story.</p>
                <p>I was crazy about this book.  It's a unbelivable universe with wizzards and  magic creature. I was able to read this book during hours without break.</p>
                <p>Harry potter remember me a lot of good memories and that's why he is one of my favorite book.</p>
