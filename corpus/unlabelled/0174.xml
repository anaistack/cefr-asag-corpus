                <p>During the Chistmas hollydays I went for the first time to NYC. I had already been before in the US but this time it was totally different because I was on my own.</p>
                <p>Actually I'm a huge basketball fan and I support the New York Knicks so I decided to go to one of their game. I had already seen a basketball game many time but never in real life, that's why I was very excited... And I wasn't disapointed ! I think the thing that amazed me the most was the atmosphere, everybody was yelling and singing during the entire game ! And the best part of it was that the Knicks won the game !</p>
