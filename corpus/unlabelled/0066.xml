                <p>On last Easter holiday, I went to Spain in Barcelona during five days.</p>
                <p>I was with a friend and her parents.</p>
                <p>There, we visited a lot of things like museum, bulding and church. The city was really special and beautiful. We spent a lot of time at the beach too because the weather was very nice. My best moment was when we ate tapas near the beach; it was the end of the day, the sky was beautiful and the ambience between us was great.</p>
