                <p>I think the most important is to have a enjoyable job, because when you enjoy something you feel better than when you only make money with your work.</p>
                <p>But i think that you can do both in the same time, with the priority of enjoying to do a job that you really like. When you do a job that you like, you have less limit, at some point, and you can make a better job than if you don't like what you are doing.</p>
                <p>When you do a job that you like, your work will be better because you want it to be the most perfect in your &quot;opinion&quot;, you can feel being satify by doing it well. Even if you're not your own boss, if you like what you're doing it will be shown in the results.</p>
                <p>When you're doing a job only for money, you lack interst on it and you're only doing what you're asking to do, without real efforts. It's like doing it like a robot, the work will be done but they won't be any special effort from you.</p>
                <p>At the end, i think the results won't be the same if you enjoy what you're doing or not.</p>
