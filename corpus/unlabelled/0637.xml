                <p>Money doesn't make happyness, but try to live without money.</p>
                <p>It's depending how many money you get with your job. If your wage isn't enough to permit to pay your's every mouth bills, it's more important to make money than have an more enjoyable job. Can you say that you have an enjoyable life if you can't afford to have a common standard of life. But, if your wage allow you to have a basic standard of life with no financials problems, it's sometime better to have an more enjoyable job than make more money. To be happy we need a minimum standard of life, but don't be jealous of yours neighbours, you always find out a richer than you except if you the richest in the world.</p>
