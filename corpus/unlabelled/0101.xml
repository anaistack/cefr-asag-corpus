                <p>Hello {name}, can i help you for you birthday? I'm the best to prepar a birthday party. If you want, i can buy the food. I think it's better if it's a easy thing to prepare like pizzas, chips,... For drinking, obviously, alcohol !!! I propose something like Sangria, beer,... and you must buy soft drinking too. it's better for people who can't drink. I also can  phone to all your friends but prepare a list, it's easier for me. it's important to reserve a large room. In fact, if you have too much people, it's not cool to refuse some friends. For music; don't worry. My best friend is an amazing DJ and he isn't expensive.</p>
