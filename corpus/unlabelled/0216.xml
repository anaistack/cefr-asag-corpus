                <p>I would buy a big house, along the sea in the South of France. I would organise holidays with some friends there : we would do shopping, make a big party, have fun, enjoy the sun,... I would buy a yacht to make some expeditions to see some beautiful and private islands. I would travel a lot in countries as Spain, Brazil, Africa,... I would offer some gifts to my family and friends. I would eat a lot of good things, do a lot of shopping and have a cleaning woman.I would also help people : to give money to charity by exemple.</p>
