            <div type="answer">
                <p>It's complicated to improve the environment without paying a huge amount of money.</p>
                <p>So I would first change all the things that are easy to improve. For example, if all famillies change their old lamps to a new technology as LEDs, it would reduce the consumption of electricity.</p>
                <p>I would also put more trashes in the city so that the inhabitants can easilly throw their waste in it. Indeed, in many countries their are not enough thrashes so everybody throws their plastics, bottles... on the ground. The cities would be cleaner.</p>
                <p>There are all little things which everybody can do to improve the environment. If everyone do something to help the planet, it would make plenty of things simple.</p>
