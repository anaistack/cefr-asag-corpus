                <p>If I had 1 million euros, I would invest that million in a charitable project. I would visit poor countries and help them. I would buy many foods or clothes for poor people. I will organize a big funny show with clowns en differents artists for children that have not the chance to can see an event like this in their life. I would put a smile on the face that every children in the whole world. I think it is the most beautiful thing I can do with 1 million euros.</p>
