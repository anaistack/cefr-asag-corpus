                <p>Studay abroad should be a compulsory part of education because it helps you learning new languages and new people. Furthermore, it changes your way of seeing the people around you. Every student should have the opportunity to go to another countries without having to pay anything! With different teachers, we can also see the different points of view of the education all over the world but also the different points of view of the students!</p>
                <p>You can also find jobs in another country that doesn't exist in your home country. So maybe you will find a job in your host country.</p>
                <p>And last but not least, study abroad is the best thing to know who you really are and who you want to be in the near future.</p>
