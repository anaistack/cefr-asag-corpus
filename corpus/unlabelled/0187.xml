                <p>The best book I've ever read is &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; of Antoine de St Exup√©ry.</p>
                <p>This book was a gift when a was younger, and I loved it because just the story was great.</p>
                <p>Before that, I had already read some passages of it at school, and I found them funny.</p>
                <p>But what I really appreciate in this book, it is that everybody can read it at all ages. The comprehension of the story is different when you grow up, because you can understand more things, and the moral lessons that are in.</p>
                <p>So, years after I received it, I still love it, and I can read it again and again. It always learns me something about life, makes me think about my trajectoire of life, and makes me happy.</p>
                <p>And finally, I love share my love for this book and encourage people to read it too.</p>
