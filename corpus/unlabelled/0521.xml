                <p>Hello guys</p>
                <p>I didn't write for a while but i'm back. I didn't write because I attended an event !</p>
                <p>What event? I can hear you where i'm!</p>
                <p>I went to a show. A one man show, Dan Gagnon was in Belgium, it was awesome.</p>
                <p>And you know what? This guy made his show with nothing. He didn't ask for money and gave an envelope to people and people would put in what they want.</p>
                <p>If they laugh a lot, they gave a lot of money if they have a lot of money. I'm poor but if i could i'd put 500â‚¬ in this envelop because i laugh so much. I was so happy when i got out. I love this guy, you need to see him.</p>
                <p>And guess what, he's Canadian. Canadian are known to be friendly. And now, i know they can be funny ! :D</p>
