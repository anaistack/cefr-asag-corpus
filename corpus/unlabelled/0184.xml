                <p>The best book I've ever read is &quot;At the research of the Chupacadabra&quot; by Alexandre Mo√Ø! It's seems not very serious for a title but a Chupacadabra is actually a mystical monster, a kind of snake. The story talks about four teenagers in vacation in their grandfather's house when they discover that their grandfather is actually a older member of a secret organisation which studies monsters like that. The four cousins decide to continue their grandfather's researches. The investigation will lead them to Paris and they will be confrontate to many issues due to their young age or just because the invastigation is very dangerous.</p>
