                <p>Last holiday, i did a beautiful travel in France with my family (my 4 brothers, my father and me). The journey was very long but we were happy to arrive near the sea. During 2 weeks, we did a lot of activity together and it was a pleasure to share moments with them because we can't see each other during the year. I remember this holiday because it's one of the rarely moments that we share together.</p>
