                <p>I don't agree with this assertion. Even if abroad studies could improve your level of languages, you learn less things because you can't plainly understand the persons in charge of you. In the case of a training period, you don't create work relations that could be necessary for your future. Furthermore, a person who doesn't want to go abroad will not improve his languages, because go studying abroad should be a voluntary choice, that imply motivation. Finally, the coast of abroad studies is very expensive. I'm more in favour of immersive studies, where some lessons are given in other languages than your mother tongue.</p>
