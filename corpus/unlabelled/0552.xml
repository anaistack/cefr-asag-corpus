                <p>The best book I've ever read is the &quot;Shôdôka&quot;. It is the second zen's poetry. It's a Japanese novel but it can be also song. I'm very found of Zen Soto philosophy and this novel has been rewritten by Sodo Sawaki who was a great Zen's master. It was an example in my all life. It is composed of 78 poetries and it represented a manier of being; During the reading it was a real enchantment from the start to the end. I read it a lot of times during my life, and each time I discovered something new. I loved it because it is a book but also a poetry a lesson of life, an other manier of thinking, of leaving, of seeing and so on...</p>
