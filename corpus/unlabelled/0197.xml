                <p>The best book I've ever read is &quot;Wild&quot;. The autor talks about herself. When her mom died, she had a very difficult life, she had problems with her studies,... She didn't want to finish university. So she take the decision to make a very long walk between Mexico and Canada. Then she will have to walk on mountains for months. On her road, she met a lot of different person. Some of them did'nt undersood her decision to leave her life to be alone for months in nature. Some of them encouraged her to continue, even if sometimes this experience is not easy for her. She broke her limits and finished it with a smile. She could start a new life and be happy again.</p>
