                <p>I guess that depends for each one. We all have to find balance between a fun and interesting job and get enough money. And how much money that means to you or what do you find fun is very personnel and can be a lo different from the next guy.</p>
                <p>For me, it's important to have enough money to pay the rent, food, clothing, doctors and a little entertainement. As soon as I have that, I will focus on finding an interesting and challenging job.</p>
                <p>If the job is boring or making me sick, that mean it's time to start to look for a new one.</p>
                <p>Still for me, there is no point to work in a living hell just to be richier. We spend to many hours working to allow it to be a nightmare</p>
