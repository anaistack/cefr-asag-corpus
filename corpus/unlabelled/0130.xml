                <p>If I had 1 million euros I would go in sweden to built a small house near of a gorgeous lac and far away from de civilisation. I would lived of fishs and plantes from the lac and my garden. Each sundays I would go to the market to sell the rest that i don't eat. During the winter I would like to walk in Lapland with friends and just be cool have fun and be in harmony with the nature. At the end of my live I would split my money between my childrens and an association for the climat change.</p>
