                <p>As far as I'm concerned, I rarely read books but so far I remimber &quot;digital&quot; was astonishing. It occurs in the present and speak about a code which need to be broken. The book is so well thought that it is harsh to explain the mainly idea behind. It's turn that the autor is well-known but i don't remimber his name.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, I read strips. I really enjoy it and strips are a kind of belgian's speciality. The better remains &quot;thorgal&quot;. I read them in a twinkling of an eye so the story is good. It's dramatic the number of differents strips across the world.</p>
