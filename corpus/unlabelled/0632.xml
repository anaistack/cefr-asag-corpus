                <p>I don't think that an employee who works in a boring company with a huge salary will do a long career there.</p>
                <p>young workers search a modern company where they are happy. Of course, if we can have a good and pleasant job with a decent salary... why not? I currently off work now and I hope that I will find a new opportunity where the boss is cool and prefer to have a good atmosphere in the open-space that employees who make money but don't talk to each other. Win more but spend bad times at work... that is not my life's philosophy!</p>
