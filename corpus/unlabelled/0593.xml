                <p>Study abroad can be a compulsory part of education for many reasons. At first, it opens to alterity and novelty, to other ways of living or thinking. So, it makes you leave your &quot;confort zone&quot; what is, I think, a key point of education. Secondly, it allows you to discover an other language that is something very important in our globalized world. Finally, it's the best way to learn about himself because you have to manage alone.</p>
                <p>But it doesn't have to be an obligation in education because it's expansive to go in an other country and everybody cannot afford it. However, it's clear that it's a kind of initiative to support.</p>
