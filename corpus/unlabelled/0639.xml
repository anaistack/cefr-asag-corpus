                <p>I think that public transport should be less expensive, and more reliable.</p>
                <p>Public transport are more and more on strike for bad reasons, and passengers are always taken hostage. Busses and taxis pollute a lot in towns. They should use an electrical engine to ride in towns, with batteries rechargeable from the sun.</p>
                <p>For example there is not enough places in my train on the morning, so I have to take my own car to go to work, so do all my colleagues...</p>
                <p>Unfortunately cars with electric engine are too expensive for me to by one, and the electrical battery life is not good enough to ride all day long.</p>
                <p>I hope we will have high performance electrical cars in the future, and also affordable to all of us...</p>
