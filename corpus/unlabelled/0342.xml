                <p>I think that is more important to make more money, because even if everyone tells &quot;oh no, money is not important, I prefer to do a job that I like blabla&quot;, money is VERY important in our actual society. It's very good to have a job that you like, but if that doesn't provide you enough money to raise a family, or to follow your dreams (moreover if your biggest dreams is to travel the world)... When I see poor people in the street for example, maybe if we can think that they're happy in their poverty (thing that I have very difficult to believe but that  some people claim), they surely prefere to have money. And I think that a job is not a very important part of our life: yes, maybe it's a boring job that you do (and there is still chances to have a enjoyable job that gives you money), I don't think it will bother me to do a boring job to make more money if I have a good life when I come home, and that I see that my money can make my family (or even me) happier. I don't say that money is everything to me, but I can't imagine me of people close to me living in poverty.</p>
