                <p>The environment is one of the most important points for us and for the futures generations in the future. It is sure that we have to be careful about it. I will give some advice that I think would be heard for a beter future.</p>
                <p>For me, the essential aspect to improve the environment is the entity. We have to be all concerned, and word together. Working together will bring us force because we could reject some type of products, or some type of acts which are not ecological friendly. More than that we would create some laws for all the country together, because some countries are nowadays really bad for the environment, due to their bad laws.</p>
                <p>Working together on the same project with the same priority is for me the best issue to the ecological situation.</p>
