                <p>A few months ago I went to the FIFF, the International French speaking Film Festival. I was volunteer there. There are always a lot of famous people answering journalists under the public place. While I came back from one of the three theaters to have a drink I was a bit absent-minded and tired. So I haven't took care of the among of people staying there. Then I woke up. A girl was screaming like she have seen a spider. It was not a spider. Neither a mouse or any other scary beast. It was Vanessa Paradis whose is not frightening. Actually she's even a very charming beast ;-)</p>
