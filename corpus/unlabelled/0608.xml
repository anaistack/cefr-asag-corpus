                <p>It is more important to have an enjoyable job than to make money.You have also to make money in our society but it is very important to feel good in our job. It is not possible to work with people who are not friendly; People at work have to help each other.People stay at work eight hours each day and five days each week;So they must be happy and have to comunicate with the others.It is not always possible to have fun at work but it should be the case most of the time.You can also at work make friends . Having a good relationship with your boss is certainly as important as making money!</p>
