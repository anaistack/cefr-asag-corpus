                <p>I really think that it's more important to have an enjoyable and interessant job.</p>
                <p>Actually, we give, each day, at least 8 hours to our job and it will last, so hope we, 40 years of our life. How boring it woudl be if we had to go to work every day without interest, waiting for the end of the days and just thinking about the money we'll have at the end of the month.</p>
                <p>To consider our job as usefull for the firm, for the society or for the humanity will really be more rewarding because of the satisfaction it will bring to us.</p>
                <p>Selfishness has never brought happiness. On the contrary, generosity gives sense to the life.</p>
