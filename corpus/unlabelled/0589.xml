                <p>A the matter of fact, I'd prefer have both. But, if I really have to choose I think that the first option is the best. Indeed, have an enjoyable job has also a side effect about money (I mean: not only about the wage). I you are happy at work yo're more healthy (so, you don't need of physicians an medicines) and to achieve yourself through a &quot;second life&quot; (like holydays or others) is less important. On the other hand, I you just make money, without any interest for your job, you're spending the third part of you're life (and perhaps the half if you consider that to sleep is also loosing time) in a kind of black hale. Actualy, money can't buy happiness ..and life spand.</p>
