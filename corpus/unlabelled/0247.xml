                <p>I think the best book I ever read is &quot;blue herb&quot; because this book leave mark on me. The book is a true story and the author is anonym. I must read the book at school, and even now I know the story like it was yerterday. It explain the hard story of a young women, who takes a lot of drogs and she must make a lot of difficults things like prostitution to meet her needs. She must live alone to manage herself because she can't count on the other. This book remind me the chance I have about my life and my education too.</p>
