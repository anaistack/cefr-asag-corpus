                <p>Hi !</p>
                <p>I'm writting for you because I'd want to thanking you for your invitation. I'm very happy to see you and having good time with you. If I guess you'll have a lot of things to do so I'd be happy to help you for the dinner, drinking, music, local,... If you want I can ask to my neighbourg for the cake because he's a bakker and his cakes are so delicious ! I can also ask to my grand father for the wine he is able to product it and  he'd be very happy of doing it very cheaper.</p>
                <p>I'm hopefully wainting for your answer and I hope my help will be helpful.</p>
                <p>I kiss you,</p>
                <p>Your best friend.</p>
