                <p>Holiday in Croatia</p>
                <p>In July, I was in Croatia with my two sons. We were in a beautifuf hotel near Pula. It was very hot. There was an underground crossing the city. It was very practical. We visited the arenas. These were very nice and old. The remains of an old villa were under the arenas. They were hundreds of ancient amphorae. After this visit, we came back by bus to the hotel. On our return, we found a big cake and fruit for my son's bithday.</p>
                <p>That was a splendid trip</p>
