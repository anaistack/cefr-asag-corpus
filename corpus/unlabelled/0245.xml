                <p>If I had 1 millions euros, depending on  how i would have got it, I would spend it in different ways.</p>
                <p>If I had earned it with my work, I think I would use it a little everyday to do wathever I want to do, because it means that my work is going well and that I don't really have to worry about money. But if I had won it, I would deffenitely spare it, to be sure that if I have a problem I can get over it.</p>
