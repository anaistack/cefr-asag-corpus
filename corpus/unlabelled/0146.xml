            <div type="answer">
                <p>The studies in Catholique University of Louvain are so expensives.so, it's more expensives for the international student.</p>
                <p>in fact,the tuitions fees for the international students are 5 time more expensives than the basic tuition fess(minerval).</p>
                <p>according to that,many internationals students have a dificulties to finance thier studies and pay the accommodation fees.</p>
                <p>so,if i had 1 millions euros,i would sittle down an organisation to come in help with some of them who have a good average at school,and help them to pay a part of thier accommodation fees.</p>
                <p>normaly,1 million euros it's not enough to solve all the problem but at least for one or two years,it could be a good hepl for them.</p>
