                <p>The best best that i read? I can't remember but i can tell I prefer read books from &quot;La comtesse de SÃ©gur&quot;. This book contain theater pieces. I remember that the title was &quot;Contes et proverbes&quot;.</p>
                <p>It was a small book with a blue coverture and a small drawing. There were five or six different texts. It's really a great book! It was really easy to identificate every persons and it's not only a book for the children. It's also a book full of live's lesson.</p>
                <p>For example it was been explain that the lies could be our ennemies or we can't judge the people about their pass because they can change...</p>
                <p>It's why I think that's a lovely book!</p>
