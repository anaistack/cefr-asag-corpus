                <p>I think it is important to have an enjoyable job because you will work for years. If you don't like your job how are you gonna do to be happy in your life ? Money isn't the only thing you need in your life. I think that if you are happy your friends will &quot;feel it&quot; and will stay around. Same thing for your family and coworkers. But let's be honest, money is important too. You just need to find the right balance between those two. Life is about making choices so everyone has to feel what is better to him/her. But in my opinion, I'd rather have a nice job and a  less money (because money isn't the only thing that makes you richer) than a crappy job with lots of money that I'm wouldn't even enjoy.</p>
