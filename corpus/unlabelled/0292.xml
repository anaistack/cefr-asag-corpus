                <p>Some people think that it is very important to make a lot of money to have a comfortable life. All people have to be completly blossomed in their work. So I think that it is very important to have an enjoyable job than making money.</p>
                <p>Of course making a lot of money can be the goal of a lot of people. Some people find an enjoyable job and make also money. This situation is the perfect deal for everyone. Sinds the first years of our professional live we can accept a unenjoyable job to make money and to earn experiences.</p>
                <p>To conclude, it is important to have at least an enjoyable job but people don't want to be difficult if they start in the professional live.</p>
