                <p>Hey!</p>
                <p>I have received your invitation today, in my mail box. It is pretty incredible that you are celebrating your birthday in Disneyland and I could never missed this for everything in the world.</p>
                <p>How are we going to the parc? Are we going to take the bus?</p>
                <p>My sister has a new car and she can, if you want to, take a few of us until Paris but she only got three places in her car so if we are taking this solution, we absolutely need an other car.</p>
                <p>Could you quickly send me an answer?</p>
                <p>See you.</p>
