                <p>Yesterday, I was in an event at New-York. It was an event of the makeup with Mac Cosmetics. It was very interrested because I love makeup. We have tested the new collection for the summer.</p>
                <p>The color of the makeup is very pretty, it is light. It was the first time that I go at an event like this. Most of people in this event are girls who do video in Youtube.</p>
                <p>During the event, I meet a girl. It is {name}. She comes from Canada and she does videos.</p>
