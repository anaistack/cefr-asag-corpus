                <p>Yestrerday I saw the best football match of the last 3 years. It was the quarter final of the European League.</p>
                <p>The two teams were Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund. They played at Anfield, the Liverpool's stadium.</p>
                <p>Before the match the supporters of the two teams sang the &quot;you will never walk alone&quot;, it is a famous song of the Beatles who were born in Liverpool.</p>
                <p>The match was so intence. It was due to the teams that were giving their heart for the match.</p>
                <p>Dortmund was wining the match 0-2 when the first liverpool's goals arrived.</p>
                <p>At the end Liverpool wan the match 4-3 with a last minute goal.</p>
