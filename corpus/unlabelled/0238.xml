                <p>In the last days, monday exactly, I spent one of the best moment of my life. For my birthday, my parents had had the good idea to offer me a place for the Hans Zimmer concert at Brussels. This film music composer is the most influent person in this artistic domain at present. He composed for some of the best films and received a lot of prices, like an Oscar for his job on &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 1994. He is also the prefered composer by filmmakers like Christopher Nolan or Gore Verbinski. His talent can be resumed in a particular care to the geographic context in which the film take place.</p>
