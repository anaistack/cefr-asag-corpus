                <p>The best books I've ever read are the trilogy &quot;Fifty shades of grey&quot;. This book had been writted by E.L James.</p>
                <p>I liked reading this book because it was very entertaining and he provided me some reflexions. I asked myself about the background of Christian Grey. Why was he so ruthless.</p>
                <p>In deed i didn't get it at the beggining but throughout the book i had knew information and i better understood his attitude.</p>
                <p>Moreover the love story between Christian and Anastasia were very enthralling.</p>
                <p>If you ask me which book of the thrilogy I would choose it's the last because it's the  embodiment of their life.</p>
