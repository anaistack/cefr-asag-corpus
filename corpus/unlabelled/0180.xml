                <p>Hi everyone!</p>
                <p>Last week, I was at the concert of my favourite singer, Passenger. We went to Brussels, what a great city. It was awesome! I didn't expect to have so much fun. All my friend were with me, we sang along for almost every song. He is a excellent singer, joyfull and friendly with his public. On the first part of the show, we saw a band who played rock, we danced a lot, it was very funny. The organisation was great, every artist were on time. We didn't have to wait too much. The AB is a great place, I always go there to see concert. I can't wait for the next one.</p>
                <p>Cheers,</p>
                <p>{name}.</p>
