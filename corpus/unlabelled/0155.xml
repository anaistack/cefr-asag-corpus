                <p>If I had 1 million, I think I would give parts of it to associations that helps road injuries (because I know that those people aren't helped that much nowadays).</p>
                <p>I would also sold it in things I've always dreamed of: like travelling around the whole world or buy stuff I wouldn't have buy without that money (a house, a car, shoes,...). I'll enjoy have the chance to spend money in the way I want it ans not in the way I have.</p>
                <p>Then, if I still have money, I would let it on a bank account so that my children can enjoy of it later, when they will need it.</p>
                <p>To my opinion it's important to think about our future but also to enjoy life we have, and how lucky I would be if I had this 1 million euros</p>
