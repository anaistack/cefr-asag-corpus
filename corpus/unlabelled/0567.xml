                <p>Do you have heard of the &quot;Moonwalkers&quot;?</p>
                <p>I saw this great movie yesterday. At first, I did not kown what to expect of this. At the end, I tell myself, &quot;wow, that was really funny!&quot;. I laught a lot. The director surely have a lot of fun with that film project. When you see this film, you feel on another planet. The actors were really convinced. A hole fantaisist world with some really hilarious scenes. I spend a great time. If you want to forget about work, troubles, and others problems you could have or if you just want to have a great time, I recommand you to go to see &quot;The Moonwalkers&quot;!</p>
