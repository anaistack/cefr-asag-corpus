                <p>If I had one million euros, I would propably save a big amount of it for my university fees. I am targeting at applying for an english university in london for my master and as you can imagine it is extremely expensive to find a flat there, even with roomates. I would spend the rest for travelling with my girlfriend and my parents in some countries we are dreaming about. Finally, I am also a volunteer in an hospital. I visit and talk with some young  cancer patients and I would definitely keep a sum for this fundation.</p>
