                <p>So much money !!</p>
                <p>With 1 million euros, I think that I would maybe become a little bit crazy.</p>
                <p>Seriously, if I had 1 million euros, the firtst thing that I would do would be offering a lot of gifts to my family. Espacially to my parents, my brothers and my little nephew (who is too cute).</p>
                <p>Then I would certainly do a lot of shopping!! In Paris, in Milan or in Barcelona, it would be better than in Belgium...</p>
                <p>One of my dream is to travel around the world, to discover a lot of new countries, new populations, new languages and new cultures. It would be preferable to do this travel with a car, it's more typical.</p>
                <p>Send me 1 million euros PLEASEEE :)</p>
