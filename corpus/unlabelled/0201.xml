            <div type="answer">
                <p>I would give it all to an association like green peace because having money isn't important for me. I hope I will be happy without it. Money make men unhappy, it makes them cupid, selfish and lonely. I would just buy a little house in the canada's hood, and relax all my life. If this money can mpake some people happy it will make me happy. Giving others a smile or make the planet better is a big point in my life.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I would keep a little of this million euros to get confortable for the rest of my life, I really don't like to be stressed.</p>
                <p>But if think I won't have one day one million euros that I don't need and can do wathever I want with it.</p>
