                <p>I will write about my holiday in Iceland. I and my father went to Iceland in january 2016 during the university holiday. Iceland is a wonderful country.</p>
                <p>We went to the island with Iceland air, that was the first time we have internet in the plane, that was very special.</p>
                <p>When we landed, the sun shined but it was cold. The people are very nice.</p>
                <p>We have done a lot of visit, we went to the blue lagoon, it's a thermal center, to a very nice national park where HBO shoot some scene of Game of Thones, I am a fan of the serie, so that was cool and a lot of other places.</p>
                <p>Iceland is a amazing country with a lot of natural ressources, that was a dream to go there and I do it.</p>
