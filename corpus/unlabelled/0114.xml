                <p>Thank you for your invitation of tomorrow. I' m really happy to take part to your birthday and to see you again.</p>
                <p>I was asking myself, do you need some help to prepare and to organize the party tomorrow? Do you need some help during the party? If you want I can do something, or i can bring something like drink or food. I can also tidy up your house on saturday, after the party because I think that it's going to be the mess.</p>
                <p>See you tomorrow so! Kiss</p>
