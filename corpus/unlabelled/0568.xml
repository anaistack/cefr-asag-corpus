            <div type="answer">
                <p>I've read so many books in my life and each of them has their charm and their emotions! That question does'nt has any sense for me. They are like your friends, you can't prefer one of them because they are all different, with their qualities and their faults.</p>
                <p>Certainly, some books can be more interesting and enthralling but I can't say the word &quot;best&quot;. For example, &quot;Le livre du voyage&quot; from Bernard Werber was a very beautiful experience of dream, imagination and relaxation next to a good (classic I know) &quot;Harry Potter&quot; with so more magic and adventure!</p>
                <p>At the end, maybe that is not a good answer but I can't answer anything else because it's what I think and I don't want change it.</p>
                <p>Thank you for reading :)</p>
