                <p>I think that the most important thing in life is to do the things you like. Therefore, I believe that having an enjoyable job is more important than making money. You'll certainly keep your job your entire life, so you have to choose it carefully, and you'd better choose something that will make you happy. Otherwise you will be really unhappy and you won't take any pleasure in doing your job. Of course, if you can find a job that you like and that is well-paid, it's even better because, let's be honest, money helps being happy.</p>
