                <p>The advice I would give to help the environment is to be more efficient with our technology. We use more and more electricity that comes from different ways like nuclear centrals way too much. If we want to help the environment we must use more green energy that comes from other ressources. Why not use the wind energy or the solar one?</p>
                <p>We live in a democracy that allows us to vote and what we can do is to vote for a politician that thinks green. It's maybe a small step but we will go forward if all of us do the same.</p>
                <p>We need to act and to think right now because our time has come to change our world. The global warming will stop and this is what we have to aim.</p>
