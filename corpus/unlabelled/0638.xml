                <p>In my opinion, to be happy in your job is really more important than to make money. Indeed, money alone doesn't make you happy. Money is of course also important in order to have a good balance in the life and in the job, but it is not enough.</p>
                <p>Beside this, studies showed that a good motivation in the job depends more on the goals or on the atmosphere with the colleagues and the hierarchy than on the salary. As a matter of fact, salary is just a part of motivation. In case of salary's increase, you 're happy at the beginning, but this feeling of happyness because of the augmentation won't stay after a few weeks or months, you will be used to this.</p>
