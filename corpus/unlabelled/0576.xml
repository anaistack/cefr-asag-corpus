                <p>The best book I've ever read was &quot;The help&quot;.  I heard a lot of positive critiscisms about this novel and now I'm thinking the same way about this book. That's why, I have read at least five times. I'm immersed in this book and the private lives of the citizens of 1960s Jackson. The novel shows the segregation between white and black. All the white people are racists.They treat the black maids poorly. They think that's they are stupids and inferior. This difference between race and the fact of slavery is mentioned several times shows us a reality that we can't ignore.</p>
