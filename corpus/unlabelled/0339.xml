                <p>The word &quot;environment&quot; is an important one. Indeed we can think about loads of different environments such as political or demographic for example.</p>
                <p>However, because of the recent facts in our country, I would like to write about the political environment which is important in this fight against the terrorism. I truly believe that the power is in the hand of our politicians and they have to find the magic bullet. I am completely ashamed to say it and I am in the misunderstanding about this. In my opinion, the only way to manage this war is to have boots on the ground, where the islamic state is located. They have to show how we are determinated and that we won't get ourselves ripped off.</p>
