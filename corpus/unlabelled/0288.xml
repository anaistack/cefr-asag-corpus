                <p>In my opinion, having an interesting job is way more important than making a lot of money.</p>
                <p>The first reason is that having a boring or a stressing job can lead to psychological deases such as bore-outs or burn-outs. A bd work can ruin one's health and there's no way it's worth it.</p>
                <p>Second, I think having a nice and interesting job can more enriching than money. Learning new things, meeting inspiring people, going beyond your limits are better reasons to get up in the morning than getting rich.</p>
                <p>Even though everyone needs money, this shouldn't be the factor that makes someone choose a job.</p>
