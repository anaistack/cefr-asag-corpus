                <p>i went to an event yesterday evening, it had taken place in Louvain-La-Neuve and it had lasted about for four hours. It had all began at 8:00 pm , i have first of all invited some friends to come to chill at my place till 12:00 pm.However, we have left my place to go to the event. Arriving at they event, they were lots of people al ready outside and with the time the number of people were just increasing . Further on, we left the party at 3:00 am. I have really liked the outgoing , it was nice and we didn't get into problems.</p>
