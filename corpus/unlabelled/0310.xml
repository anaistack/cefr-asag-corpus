                <p>In my opinion having an enjoyable job is more important than making a lot of money. In fact, people are much more productive if they are doing a job that they really like!</p>
                <p>Morover, havinga good job make you be a peron with good ethics.</p>
                <p>Finally, money can't be the main goal of life and will never compete with satisfaction at work. Actually, money can't be cure of the unhapiness of a person.</p>
                <p>To conclude, as stated by Benjamin Franklin, &quot;Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. The more a man has, the more ha wants. Instead of filling a vaccum, it makes one&quot;.</p>
