                <p>If I had 1 million euros, firstable I wouldn't tell it to anybody. I would pay all my debts, I would by a new car, and I would gard the rest for the moment. I know how easy is loose money, so, I would think with pacience what is the vest way to keep it, or to gain more. Try to never would need work for money. I know a rich man, and one day he told me: the most difficult is to gain your firs million. It means that; if you have money, you need to think how produce much money. That's all.</p>
