                <p>I would like to be surrounded by all my family and having my own life. What I am mean when I am saying my own life. In fact, it concerns a wedding, maybe with the man of my life, my own home and the more important thing, 2 of 4 children around me. Nothing more or less, just a family with a stable situation and with a lot of love. A good job could be very nice but it is not more important than having a family. I would like to unemployed than alone.</p>
