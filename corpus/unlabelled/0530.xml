                <p>I don't remember the title of the best book I've ever read but I know that it's writed by a Spanish men and translated in French. It was a story about an ancient and mysterious book. I liked it because I learned about Spain one hundred years ago, about Spanish history and there was suspense. You always wanted to read and read more to know what's happened  in the story. You couldn't imagine the end of the story but it wasn't a detective story with murder, police, ... I like to read but I like it very much when I can't stop to read a book.</p>
