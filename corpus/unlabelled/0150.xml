                <p>It's hard to imagine what this amount of money represents when you're still a student. The majority of the money would probably end up in a saving account while I would spend the rest to buy expensive things in my daily life.</p>
                <p>The most difficult parts would be to keep going to college without losing the motivation to learn and to study because the money won't be enough for a whole lifetime. On the other hand, I would chose a field that I love even though the job market for the degree isn't very promisng.</p>
