                <p>Last saturday, I went to the Brussels' Book Fair. I board the train at the railwaystation with a travel ticket that cost only 6 euros because I am a senior traveller ( more than 65 years old ) .</p>
                <p>At the fair, there was a lot of people . I had to wait at least 20 minutes before entering the book's realm.</p>
                <p>There were all sorts of books : comics strips, polars, adventures, travels, history, geography, biographies and so on. There were also several authors who were present to dedicate their books.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed very much my afternoon. I have only one regret : there was not a single book in english!</p>
