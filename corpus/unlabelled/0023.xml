                <p>When I am 30 years old, I imagine myself with my wife, and perhaps with my chid ou chidren, in a house or a flat in a little town, who knows? I hope I will have a convenient job that I appreciate instead of  getting a boring one. I wish that I will keep practising my sport, and that I will keep in touch with my best friends.</p>
                <p>I see myself still writting on the internet, and saying what I think of the society, about what I feel, just like I'm doing right now.</p>
                <p>Actually, I would like to be happy with my family, to have good relationships with my friends, to progress in my sport, to feel good in my leisures, and sure, to be healthy.</p>
