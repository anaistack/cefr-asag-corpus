                <p>If I had all this money, first of all, I would probably buy a new house in a new neighbourhood for my entire family because they deserve it. My parents buyed me all I ever wanted as a child and I want to give them back and I think it's fair in a way.</p>
                <p>Then, I would spoil my big brother and his family because he has a daughter and I want to buy a lot of presents.</p>
                <p>For his wive and he, I would give 250.000â‚¬ so they can live a life like they ever wanted.</p>
                <p>With the rest of the money, I would travel around the world and knowing all the others cultures and maybe help the poors in the third world.</p>
