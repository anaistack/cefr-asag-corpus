                <p>Having 1 million of euros can be a great opportuniy to realise all my dreams. First of all, with this money I can start my own business. As I like eating in very nice restaurants, I can open a very big restaurant with recepies from all around the world.</p>
                <p>With this money I can also travel and discouver all the continents. This money can also help me to change people's lives in the poorest countries. I can create centers for learning differents kind of professional jobs for all the young people who couldn't reach schools. The objective of that is to learn people to earn their lives by themselves.</p>
                <p>At the end , I would like to share my money with my family.</p>
