                <p>On january 2014, I went to London with my parents and my best friend during 3 days. On the first day, I visited the city with their differents monuments. The big ben was very impressionant! I eared the clock ring and i was very surprised. For me, London is a wonderfull city. On the second day, i did shopping on the Oxford Street and i must talking english in the shop. I was a little stressed but it was a good experience. This travel was the most beautiful i did.</p>
