                <p>To be honnest, I really try to be realistic with my future so I've never imagined my life if I had a million euros so far. But I can try ...</p>
                <p>I'd begin by building a huge dressing in my house, to wake up the girl in me who dreams about shoes and prom bal. And I would probably stay for one hour each day in it to chose what to wear.</p>
                <p>Secondly, if I had 1 million euros, I would buy a cosy house in Tenerife for exemple. It would allow me to escape from my life whenever I want, for just a few days ...</p>
                <p>It can seem selfish because the first things I want to do are for me and not for poor child who are starving ... But I REALLY want a dressing !</p>
