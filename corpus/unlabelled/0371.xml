In this way, the reasons of the social networks' succes story will be developed once we described the consequences of our online life on our relationships.</p>

Moreover, technologies can make your daily- life easier by giving you acces to any source of information in a single product. Another key factor is the huge financial potential of these networks given that they provide advertising place for companies.
