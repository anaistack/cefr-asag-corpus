                <p>Hi dude,</p>
                <p>At first, I would like to thank you for inviting me ! It's such a pleasure for me to participate at your 40 years birthday.</p>
                <p>I would like to help you for the organization of this little party, and so, I can bring two barrels of 50 liters of beer. As you nmight know it, I work as a technician in a famous Belgian brewery and it's easy for me to bring you beer.</p>
                <p>Also, I can come earlier to help you prepare everything you need for the party.</p>
                <p>Finally, if you really need it, I can print the invitation's papers with the printer of the work.</p>
                <p>See you soon homie,</p>
                <p>your very best friend {name}</p>
