                <p>I think it's more important to have an enjoyable job. Indeed, having a job that you don't like is going to ruin your life. You won't want to wake up in the morning to do it, you won't find it interesting and it won't teach you anything. Our society tells us that making money is the ultimate goal because that's how you are going to be important in this world, that's how you're going to be happy, to be able to care for your family... I strongly believe that money is important to live a decent life and have a chance at life for all your basic needs. But if you're living a life that you hate trying to make money, what's the point? Because let's face it, your job is a huge part of your life. So if you're spending most of your life doing a job you dislike, i think it's really sad...</p>
