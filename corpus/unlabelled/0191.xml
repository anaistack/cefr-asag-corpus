                <p>the best that i ever read is &quot;quelqu'un d'autre&quot; from Tonino Benaquista.</p>
                <p>it's a great book because you are read a story about two people who want to change their life and for they are ready to do all of it's possible from de chirugy to the &quot;false death&quot; and to know if they have passe this they meet one year later at the same place where they meet at the first time. one of this guy will leave her wife et leave her job... the orther will passe for dead and do chirurgy and creat a new personality...</p>
                <p>it's a exellent book because you can enter in the minds of tthis people who want to change all of us and all of what they know. but we dont have only the way of this person but also the thinks of her freinds et family.</p>
