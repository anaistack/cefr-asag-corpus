                <p>Three years ago, I travelled with my friends's group in Easthern Europe. More precisely, in Romenia, Hungaria and Serbia.</p>
                <p>First, we arrived in Belgrad which is the capital city of Serbia. It's a strange city... we didn't feel really safe there. Moreover, there were some buildings destroyed by the war yet. But, we had good times.</p>
                <p>Next, we had taken the train to a city in Romenia before to take an other train that take us to a small village. There, we helped poeple and farmers during one week. It was good because we met people and it's always nice to help when we can.</p>
                <p>Finally, we went to Budapest that is one of the better cities that I saw in my life. It's a wonderful city. It was a gread travel for everyone in my friends's group.</p>
