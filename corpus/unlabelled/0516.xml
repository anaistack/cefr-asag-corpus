                <p>If I had one million euro, I don't know what I would do with all that money. That's too much. May be, I would take my baggage and I would travel around de world to discover people and nature. I would like to visit South America, specially Patagonia and Perou. I would stay for a long time into places I love. I think also of Venice and Roma.</p>
                <p>I'm sure, I would give money to my two children Pierre and Caroline. They are young and need some help to buy a appartment.</p>
                <p>I'm also sure, I would help some association like MSF or Amnesty International.</p>
                <p>But, If I had,... That's a dream ....</p>
