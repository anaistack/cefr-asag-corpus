            <div type="answer">
                <p>I think study abroad don't must a compulsory but be seen like a opportunity to improve a language study, meet other cultures or do a intership.</p>
                <p>- Sometimes, after one year abroad like a second retho, it's difficult to study seriously with success.</p>
                <p>Again :</p>
                <p>- All families don't have enough money to send their teens abroad.</p>
                <p>- The diploma's are not always valid in our own country.</p>
                <p>- The teens' parents can have a lack of trust in the welcome and the security of their children.</p>
                <p>- The youngs must be enough concern to not confound studies and holidays.</p>
                <p>- with internet, children will follow international cursus at home. It will be more safe, economic mostly for parents.</p>
                <p>For:</p>
                <p>- Abroad, the teens become faster independant. They learn to face alone problems, sickess, good or bad mood ...</p>
                <p>- It is the best opportunity to learn a other language in a little time.</p>
                <p>- It's appreciate when you apply for a job in Belgium.</p>
                <p>- It you are looking forward to live in an other country; it a good opportunity to check if it like you though.</p>
