                <p>As price of goods is important in people's choice in consuming, instead of taxing on added value created, taxing on generated pollution would help people in consuming goods, products which are the less worst.</p>
                <p>Another idea is to tax imported goods produced in countries where environment standards are not as difficult to achieve as our. The objective is to play on the same playing field and give a chance to everyone to be competitive. This should concern not only environment matters but also respect of working conditions.</p>
                <p>These two measures would not be easy to put in place but would completely change a certain paradigm.</p>
