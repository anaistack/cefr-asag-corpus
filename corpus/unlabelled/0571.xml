                <p>(firstly, i did not know what meant &quot;attended&quot;. I will write this without translator)</p>
                <p>So yesterday i came back from ski in Val Thorens. I have been there for a week (from saturday to the next saturday) with my four friends from Namur. I did not see them since one year because three of us failed our studies in the university so we took differents ways and we have not really enough time to meet each other.</p>
                <p>We rided at five in a friend's car so it was pretty close in there but finally we arrived to our destination.</p>
