                <p>Last week, I've went to a event in Bruxelles. It was a concert of Puggy, an Belgian band. Show was began at 8 PM et finished at 10 PM. It was amazing! The room was full, with a lot of young people. After the show, we have doing take photo's with artists. When It was the end, with my friends, we have go on Bruxelles city, to have a good time on terrasse bar. Everyone drunk a beer and we ordered french fries, that was a typical Belgian meal! When I'm coming home, I had a lot of memories.</p>
