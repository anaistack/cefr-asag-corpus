            <div type="answer">
                <p>First of all, I'll just say that every little things are important. There are not &quot;little initiatives&quot;. Let take the example of Louvain-La-Neuve, if every students try to sort the waste or take the train, it means that nearly 30 000 persons (whithout all the personals) are taking care of the environment. So, the first advice I can give is to see the big picture and don't think that your personal initiative are useless because we are thousands to do the same. Secondly, people could try to buy local products. It is difficult because we never know from where procucts come, that's why we need to create some labels for our local products (it will avoid a lot of pollution if we reduce the freight of some products). Finally, we could eat less fish and meat, for example we can try to eat veggie the week-end because we have much time to cook. The change could come from entreprises and governments because they can take important decisions about pollution and so on but first we have to show that we care about environment by doing &quot;our little initiatives&quot;.</p>
