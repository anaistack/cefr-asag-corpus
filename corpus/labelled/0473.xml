                <p>it was last summer i was in Spain with my family and we would leave the next day. so i wanted to enjoy a last time of the beach and there was a party near the sea. i went with my cousin and it was very great. we danced, we laughed a lot, we met two very handsome guys but it was funny because we didn't understand a word of what they told us as we can't speak spanish. we really had a good time. my favorite moment was when the sun goes down because i like it it's so wonderful. then we went back home abd we watched a tv show together. i really like when my cousin come with me on vacation. she's so funny and we always have a great time !</p>
