                <p>My name is {name}, i'm belgian and today I want to share with you something that happened to me yesterday afternoon. I currently am in holiday and decide to leave my country to visit others. Me and my cousin choose to visit Denmark. We so have to take the plane to Copenhagen. That was the first time we were taking the plane by our own, we were so a little stressed. Once in the airport we were running everywhere asking for everybody where do we have to go. It was a this right moment that the 2 bomberman decide to blow up the airport. We were both safe but it was very frightened...there were people laying on the ground, smoke and dust everywhere.</p>
                <p>We were well taken in charge by the rescue and for both of us this history end well but Belgium keep scares and bruises of it. Pray for Belgium.</p>
