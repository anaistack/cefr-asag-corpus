                <p>I think thos question is very difficult. One does not simply know which book is &quot;the best&quot; he or she has ever read. My first thought would be of course for the Harry Potter saga, wich has made all my childhood and participated in a big proportion to my construction as an adult person. Yet today I often use it as a reference for many parts in my life. Bit is it the &quot;best book&quot; I've ever read ? I must answer no for many reasons. Which book then? My favoriete writter is Bernard Werber, bit it isn't the question and I couldn't choose just one of his. I guess my final answer will be the one I'm reading right now, first because he is really good, speacking about japan and modern live, but mostly because he perfectly fit to my current mood. And it isn't the definition of the best book anyone could ever read? the one who at some point of life and time, just suit you.</p>
