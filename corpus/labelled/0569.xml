                <p>I was on holiday in Scotland. Scotland is a famous country in the north of England. There is many landscape without city, we lived in the middle of the nature , the wind was blowing and the sky was always grey. We saw a lot of sheeps in the meadows. There are also many fjords which enter the scotisch earth. One of then is very famous, and many tourist go ther in order to see the Loch Ness Monster . The inhabitants call him Nessie . He looks likes a big snake floating on the see; it possible to see him, at some special hours of the day.I was very lucky because I saw him, I took many pictures fron him. I speak to him too, I tell him &quot; Hello , how are you, I came from Belgium expecially for your, I am very happy to see you&quot; - Hy, {name} , he answers, have a nice trip , here ! See you soon, next year.</p>
