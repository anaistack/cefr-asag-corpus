                <p>I went to Lisboa in September. I was with 3 friends there. We lent an appartment not in the center of Lisboa. To go to Lisboa, we had to take a train during 20 minuts. There was a beach only 1 minuts far of the appartment.</p>
                <p>One day, we had decided to visit Cintra. It is a multicolor castel which is in the mountain of Lisboa. The weather was really nice and hot so we wore summer clothes. But, when we arrived there... The weather has changed, it was really cloudy. It wasn't funny to be dressed like we were cause it was cold outside at this time. Therefore, we visited the castel really fast to go back to the beach or anything else but with the sun. It was a good idea cause when we went back in the city, there was no more clouds.</p>
                <p>Fortunatly, we enjoyed Cintra and the stay there. Lisboa is a nice place to be. There are a lot of things to visit, to do, and to see. The cooking there was delicious. To summerize, I advise this city to go on holiday.</p>
