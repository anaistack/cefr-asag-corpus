                <p>Let's first see what privacy still means nowadays, knowing that most people have a mobile phone linked to an e-mail address, have private and professional accounts on social media websites, manage their bank accounts online, as well as their travels and all kinds of other purchases. They probably save all their pictures and films on their laptop, communicate through social medias or relevant apps. Not to say all of this information might be saved in the 'cloud'. Believing that all this very personal information remains private would be rather naive, I guess. We know that it is being sold and used for commercial and marketing purposes - &quot;If you're not paying for the product, you are the product'. And although all of the above is normally done in full knowledge of the facts, it remains a very personal decision/choice, which is also a right, that should be somehow protected, as many of us are de facto living in the public eye.</p>
