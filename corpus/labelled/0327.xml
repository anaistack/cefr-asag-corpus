                <p>Any people agree with this question but as I'm concerned, i don't think so.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>Studying abroad can be beneficial for our language level or to improve our ability to adapt a new milieu. But I tend that it mustn't be compulsory. Most of the people needn't to learn foreign language for their future job.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>Furthermore, I would argue that any people don't want to leave their friend, their family and their university to study in a foreign country. It's also possible that the study level is better in their country than abroad, therefore it isn't interesting to leave.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>Taking everything into consideration, i don't say that studying abroad is harmful. On the contrary, I'm convinced that it can be a great experience but I tend to think that it shouldn't be a compulsory part of education.</p>
