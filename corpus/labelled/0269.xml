            <div type="answer">
                <p>If I had the chance to won 1 million euros, I would give a part at associations for children who are so hungry in Africa for exemple and also for animals. I'm obviously going to use it to do some shopping with my sister, just to buy what we want and also to travel around the world. I really would like to discover new culture, new people, beautiful landscapes and just enjoy the peace on high moutains.</p>
                <p>I also would like to use it to buy a house in Switzerland just in front of the Lake, it's just a dream for me.</p>
                <p>I would give money to my parents because they had done it for me before and also to my sister to facilitate her life.</p>
                <p>But I wouldn't stop working, I would stay in the active life and mostly continue a 'normal life'.</p>
