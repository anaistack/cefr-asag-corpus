                <p>First of all, I think that work takes a big place in everyone's life. That's why I would probably say that it's more important to have en enjoyable work than to make money. In fact, both would be perfect... But in my opinion if you don't feel good when you are at work and if you don't even want to go to work when you get up, then it's a real problem because that could have really huge consequences on your personal life. My point of view is that when you don't feel good at work, you don't feel good in life. A lot of companies don't care about how their employees feel at work. They only think about making profit instead of caring about people. The worst is that some people become depressive because of their work. And being depressive can lead to suicide. This is why having an enjoyable work is more preferable according to me.</p>
