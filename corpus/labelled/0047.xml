                <p>Last year, I went to Vietnam with six friends during three weeks. That was very fun, interesting and a little bit hard too. We went first to the capital, Hanoi. It is so different that our culture , there is a lot of people all day all night in the street, we can think that the city never sleep ! After that we went to the beautiful Halong Bay : that's one of the seven beautifulest places in the world and we understood why. that's a paradisiac view and place and we were so grateful to be there.</p>
                <p>We also did a treck in the North of the country in Sapa, a lot of wonderful landscapes during three days, we thought that really was a place to go in your life. We came back in Belgium with a lot of memories.</p>
