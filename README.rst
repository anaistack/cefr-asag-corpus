This dataset contains a number of short texts written by non-native speakers 
of English. Each participant was asked to provide a short answer to an 
open-ended question which targeted the proficiency level in which he/she was
placed. Each question is therefore labelled with a particular proficiency level,
as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Moreover, 299 of the collected answers were also labelled using the CEFR, by
a panel of three CEFR-certified examiners. Their labels, as well as a 
majority-vote label, have been added to each one of these texts.

All texts are encoded in a TEI format.

More information can be found in the following `paper <https://aclanthology.org/W17-5018>`_.
